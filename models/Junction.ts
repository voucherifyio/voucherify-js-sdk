* Logical Operator Between Filters. Filter by conditions set on the `junction` parameter indicating how the `conditions` should be accounted for in the query. An `AND` is an all-inclusive logical operator, meaning the `AND` operator displays a record if **ALL** the conditions separated by AND are TRUE, while  an `OR` operator displays a record if **ANY** of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
