# Changesets Release Action (release.yaml)

This action for [Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) creates a pull request with all of the package versions updated and changelogs updated and when there are new changesets on `main`, the PR will be updated. When you're ready, you can merge the pull request and the action will publish the packages to npm for you.
