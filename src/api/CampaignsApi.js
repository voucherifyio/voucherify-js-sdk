     * Export transactions is an asynchronous process that generates a CSV file with the data about credit movements on all gift cards or point movements on all loyalty cards in a given campaign. To export transactions: 1. In the export request, use parameters to select which fields will be exported, in what order, and which data will be filtered. 2. Use the returned id to track the export status with the [GET Export](/api-reference/exports/get-export) method. 3. In the GET Export method, when the returned status field has the DONE value, the export file has been generated. 4. Use the URL in the result property to download the file. You must be logged to your Voucherify account on a given cluster in the browser to be able to download the file. An export request will almost always result in a single file being generated by the system. However, when the data volume is large, the system may split the results into multiple files. An example export file can look as follows:    👍 Export Loyalty Campaign Transactions  For loyalty campaigns, this method works in the same way the [POST Export Loyalty Campaign Transactions](/api-reference/loyalties/export-loyalty-campaign-transactions) does.
